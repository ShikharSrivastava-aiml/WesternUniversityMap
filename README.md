Welcome to the Geographical Information System design documentation for the University of Western Ontario Campus project! This project aims to create
a comprehensive GIS application for the university campus, including various maps and visualizations that campus administrators can use for students,
faculty, and visitors. The goal of this project is to provide a better understanding of the campus and its surroundings, identify areas that may need
improvement, and guide future development and planning efforts.

# Overview
The University Campus GIS design is a software solution that addresses the need for a more detailed understanding of the campus and its interior spaces.
This project involves collecting, organizing, and analyzing various data sets related to the campus, such as locations of multiple resources, facilities, and
other points of interest. The GIS design will help us create maps that provide valuable insights into the campus and its surroundings, enabling its users to
navigate within the building.

# Objectives
The general objectives of this design document and project are as follows:
To create a comprehensive GIS design of the university campus and its surroundings.
To create an interactive mockup of the user interference for our software.
To provide a valuable tool for understanding the campus and its indoor spaces.
To increase knowledge of the layout of Western's underground tunnel system to better navigate between buildings.
To deliver a high-quality and user-friendly software solution.


# IMPORTANT 

IF JAR DOES NOT WORK RUN THE App.java class, using an IDE, located in the src folder within the repoisitory. email: ssriva252@uwo.ca for inquiries if running has issues. thanks.



How to Run the Project
	•	The application can be run from an IDE or as a standalone desktop application
	1	To run the application from an IDE:
	2	Import the project into your preferred IDE
	3	Make sure that your project is using Java 11 or later
	4	Run the App.java file located in the uwo/team33/App.java
	1	To run the application as a standalone desktop application:
	2	Navigate to the project directory in a terminal or command prompt
	3	Execute the command "java -jar application.jar" to run the application
	4	The login screen will appear
How to Use the Project - User
	•	Once the application is running, a new user must create an account (either a User account or a Developer Account)
	•	To create a USER account, all that is required is a username (one that is not already in use) and a password
	•	To create a DEVELOPER account, an access code must be entered when creating the account
	•	Once the account has been created successfully, the user/developer can log in using their credentials and use the application
	•	As a USER, you are able to search and select buildings, floors, and POIs
	•	You are able to favourite existing POIs, and this favourite will be saved with your account and can be accessed at another time
	•	Furthermore, you can add your own POIs by clicking on the location of desire, which you can name and provide a description for; you can also access them faster in a separate menu
