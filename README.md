How to Run the Project
	•	The application can be run from an IDE or as a standalone desktop application
	1	To run the application from an IDE:
	2	Import the project into your preferred IDE
	3	Make sure that your project is using Java 11 or later
	4	Run the App.java file located in the uwo/team33/App.java
	1	To run the application as a standalone desktop application:
	2	Navigate to the project directory in a terminal or command prompt
	3	Execute the command "java -jar application.jar" to run the application
	4	The login screen will appear
How to Use the Project - User
	•	Once the application is running, a new user must create an account (either a User account or a Developer Account)
	•	To create a USER account, all that is required is a username (one that is not already in use) and a password
	•	To create a DEVELOPER account, an access code must be entered when creating the account
	•	Once the account has been created successfully, the user/developer can log in using their credentials and use the application
	•	As a USER, you are able to search and select buildings, floors, and POIs
	•	You are able to favourite existing POIs, and this favourite will be saved with your account and can be accessed at another time
	•	Furthermore, you can add your own POIs by clicking on the location of desire, which you can name and provide a description for; you can also access them faster in a separate menu
